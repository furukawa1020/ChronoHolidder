    <h1>Privacy Policy for ChronoHolidder</h1>
    <p>Last updated: December 06, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>ChronoHolidder ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application (the "App") handles your information.</p>

    <h2>2. Location Data</h2>
    <p><strong>We collect and use your precise location data</strong> solely to provide the core functionality of the App: identifying historical information about the ground you are standing on ("Peak Era Extraction").</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location data is sent to our servers to query historical databases (Wikidata, GBIF).</li>
        <li>This data is <strong>Ephemeral</strong>: We do not store your location history on our servers. It is processed in real-time and discarded after the analysis is returned to your device.</li>
        <li>You can revoke location permissions at any time through your device settings, though this will disable the App's core features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Camera Usage (AR Mode)</h2>
    <p>The App uses your device's camera for the Augmented Reality (AR) feature. Camera input is processed locally on your device to overlay historical visualizations. We do not record, store, or transmit video or images from your camera.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>If you choose to save a "Collection" item, the location and era data associated with that item are stored locally on your device using SQLite. This data is not synced to the cloud unless you explicitly use a backup feature (future implementation).</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services which may collect information used to identify you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Play Services</li>
        <li>OpenStreetMap / Mapbox (for map tiles)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: support@chronoholidder.com</p>
